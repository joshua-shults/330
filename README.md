How do I approach designing software?

One design skill I learned from this course for my work on this project was structuring the code to be easily readable, as well as easy to find where I needed to make changes. The example code we were given was great for this, it contained an example 3D scene code that was very well laid out. I am getting better at structuring code, but seeing an example by a professor helped a lot. The design process I followed for this project was adding on to the 3D scene in sections. Such as I completed the basic layout of all the objects first, positioning them where they needed to be in the scene and making them the correct size to emulate my photo. Second, I began texturing the objects, ensuring that they rendered properly and didn't clip into themselves. Third, I began implementing lighting to the scene. And finally, I added materials to the shader to apply to the objects to reflect the lighting I implemented so it would reflect the light based on its material. All of these tactics will be useful to future work, for me coding in phases is the best strategy. By ensuring that the first portion of the work is done, and that it is running without issues, moving on to the next portion is all the easier as well as debugging is easier towards the end of the project.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs incrementally, as described above. I like to first get a base done and running without errors, this base should also be formatted to be read and updated easily later. Then I add on to the base one item at a time, each time ensuring that it is working properly. I wouldn't say that my approach to developing code changed throughout this course, more or less it just solidified my approach as it worked well for me.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

So far my courses in computer science have aided me through examples as well as through structuring courses in "milestones." The milestones part being my favorite, as it lets me code incrementally and teaches me new principles with each module.
